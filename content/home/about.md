# Biography

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Stochastic Systems Lab. My research interest lies in the area of Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is a framework for problems involving sequential decision making (e.g., Chess, Traffic Signal Control, Robot Navigation) in the face of uncertainty. Such problems arise in a number of domains, wherever decisions need to be made sequentially and there is a cost or reward associated with every decision. RL theory is developed on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Dynamic Programming framework. My work involves developing new methods for RL and use it for solving exciting and complex problems in Cyber-Physical Systems, energy harvesting sensor networks and renewable energy systems.
